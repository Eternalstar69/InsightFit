# **InsightFit â€“ Obesity and Nutrition Data Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
InsightFit is a statistical analysis project that examines behavioral, dietary, and demographic factors influencing obesity. Using Python, this project applies statistical tests, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify key trends.  

## **Features**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations  
- Chi-Square tests to analyze categorical variable relationships  
- Correlation analysis for numerical variables  
- Hypothesis testing (ANOVA to be added)  
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eternalstar69/InsightFit.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd InsightFit
   ```  
3. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Run the analysis script:  
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```  

## **Usage**  
- Run the script to perform statistical analysis on obesity-related data.  
- Modify dataset paths and parameters as needed for custom analysis.  
- Visualize trends and relationships using the provided graphs and tables.  

## **Future Work**  
- Implement additional statistical tests, including ANOVA.  
- Develop predictive machine learning models for obesity classification.  
- Expand dataset for broader demographic analysis.
