# InsightFit – Obesity and Nutrition Data Analysis  

## Overview  
InsightFit is a statistical data analysis project focused on identifying behavioral, dietary, and demographic factors influencing obesity. This project leverages Python’s data science libraries to perform statistical tests, correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and create insightful visualizations to uncover key trends within obesity-related data.

---

## Features  
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and correcting data types)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with descriptive statistics and visualizations  
- Chi-Square tests to analyze associations between categorical variables  
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between numerical variables  
- Hypothesis testing including ANOVA and other statistical tests  
- Data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib  

---

## Technologies Used  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
